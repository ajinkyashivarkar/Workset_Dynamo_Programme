Revit designers come across task of creating multiple worksets in their template files. This task is time consuming and very 

monotonus. Also, desiners need to attach/link revit files corresponding to worksets. Keeping this requirement in mind, I 

have come up with Dynamo code which reads the workset and revit link data from a text file and add corresponding worksets 

and revit links. The text file can be kept anywhere on users/network machine and can be added through Dynamo input. The text 

file has particular structure which should be followed by designers for suucessful execution of code. The structure of text 

file is as below,

WorkSet=DynamoTest1,Revitlink=C:\RVT Links\DGI-HLP-GW1-XX-M3-P-Revit.rvt

"WorkSet=" Word to signify the name coming after it is name of Wortkset
"DynamoTest1" is the name of Workset
"," seperator to differentiate between Workset and Revit link
"Revitlink=" Word to signify the path of Revit link file
"C:\RVT Links\DGI-HLP-GW1-XX-M3-P-Revit.rvt" path of revit link file.
